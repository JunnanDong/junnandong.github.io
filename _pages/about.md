<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 17px">I am now working as a researcher in Tencent Youtu Lab, focusing on both the research and implementation of Large Language Model-based GraphRAG and Text2SQL. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student (since May 2022) in DEEP Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Computing, supervised by [Dr. Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/index.html) and [Prof. Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). I was nominated by both the Department of Computing and the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Science of Hong Kong Polytechnic University as the '**Best Research Postgraduate Student**' of 2024.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 17px">My research interests focus on <b>Large Language Models </b> and <b>Knowledge Graphs</b>, especially in exploring <b>Knowledge-enhanced LLMs</b> and <b>GraphRAG</b> for various tasks.</span><br>
