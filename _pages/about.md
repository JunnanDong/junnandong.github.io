I am now a first-year research student in DEEP Lab at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Computing, supervised by [Dr. Xiao Huang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/index.html "Redirecting to Dr.Huang's homepage"). 
<!-- I obtained my Master's degree at HKPolyU in 2021, majored in Information Technology. -->

Before pursuing higher degrees at HKPolyU, I served as an IT project manager in LFLogistics China, a world's leading company in supply chain (now under Maersk). Check [here](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=13533 "Redirecting to the article from Harvord Business School") for its legends from Harvord! I took lead of the system development and implementation of a large intelligent digital project for over 10 key clients, e.g., NIKE, Skechers, Under Armer, Victoria's Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, etc.
After the fascinating experience there, I ask myself two questions: 

(i) What is the real smart DATA? (ii) How could we make the DATA smarter?

In pursuit of what I dreamed of, my current major research interests include but not limit to Data Mining and Graph Learning. At present, I enjoy delving into knowledge graph error detection and commonsense question answering over knowledge graphs. The more I expose to data, the more charm I appreciate. I'm still on my way towards a smart data researcher.
